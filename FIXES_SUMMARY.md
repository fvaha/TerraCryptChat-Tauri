# Fixes Summary

## âœ… Fixed Issues

### 1. Missing Methods in Services
- **Added `getCachedFriendsForCurrentUser()` method to FriendService**
  - Location: `src/friend/friendService.ts`
  - This method was being called in ChatList.tsx but was missing from the service

### 2. Type Mismatches Between Message and MessageEntity Interfaces
- **Updated MessageEntity interface in models.ts**
  - Added `message_text?: string` field for compatibility
  - This allows both `content` and `message_text` fields to be used

- **Updated Message interface in databaseServiceAsync.ts**
  - Added `content?: string` field for compatibility
  - Ensures both interfaces can work together

### 3. Missing Properties in WebSocket Service
- **Added missing properties to WebSocketService class**
  - `connectionState: ConnectionState`
  - `reconnectAttempts: number`
  - `lastHeartbeat: number`
  - `maxReconnectAttempts: number`
  - `heartbeatInterval: number`

### 4. Fixed ParticipantService Type Mismatches
- **Updated property names to match interface**
  - Changed `userId` to `user_id`
  - Changed `chatId` to `chat_id`
  - Changed `joinedAt` to `joined_at`
  - Changed `leftAt` to `left_at`
  - Changed `isActive` to `is_active`
  - Added `participant_id` field

### 5. Fixed ChatList Component
- **Enabled friends loading functionality**
  - Uncommented the call to `friendService.getCachedFriendsForCurrentUser()`
  - This was previously disabled to avoid errors

## ðŸ”§ Remaining Issues to Fix

### 1. Message Service Type Mismatches
The following interfaces need to be aligned:
- `ChatMessage` interface in models.ts vs databaseServiceAsync.ts
- `ChatMessageWrapper` interface properties
- `Message` vs `MessageEntity` field consistency

**Specific issues:**
- `ChatMessage.content` property missing
- `ChatMessageWrapper.client_message_id` property missing
- `ChatMessage.sent_at` property missing
- Map<string, any> type issues in message handling

### 2. Interface Alignment Needed
The following interfaces need to be synchronized:
- `Message` in databaseServiceAsync.ts
- `MessageEntity` in models.ts
- `ChatMessage` in both files
- `ChatMessageWrapper` in both files

### 3. Recommended Next Steps
1. **Align all message-related interfaces** to use consistent field names
2. **Update ChatMessage interface** to include missing properties
3. **Fix Map<string, any> type issues** in message handling methods
4. **Test the application** to ensure all type errors are resolved

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact
These fixes should resolve the main issues causing the white screen:
- âœ… Missing methods that prevented initialization
- âœ… Type mismatches that caused compilation errors
- âœ… Missing properties that caused runtime errors

The remaining issues are primarily type-related and should be resolved by aligning the interfaces properly.
